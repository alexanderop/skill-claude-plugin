# Claude Code Toolkit

> Create skills, subagents, hooks, commands, and plugins for Claude Code

A comprehensive toolkit plugin that helps you create and manage Claude Code customizations with best practices built-in.

## What's Inside

This plugin provides slash commands to create:

- **Skills** - Model-invoked capabilities that Claude discovers automatically (`/claude-skill`)
- **Subagents** - Delegated AI agents with specialized roles (`/create-agent`)
- **Commands** - User-invoked slash commands for workflows (`/create-command`)
- **Hooks** - Event-triggered automations (`/claude-hook`)
- **Plugins** - Distributable Claude Code packages (`/create-plugin`)
- **Documentation** - Project CLAUDE.md files (`/claude-md`)
- **Output Styles** - Custom Claude response formatting (`/claude-output-style`)

## Available Commands

### `/claude-skill`
Create a new Claude Code skill with proper structure and best practices.

Skills are automatically invoked by Claude based on context. Perfect for extending Claude's capabilities with domain knowledge, processes, or specialized workflows.

**Usage:** `/claude-skill [skill-name] [description]`

### `/create-agent`
Create a new subagent with specialized expertise and tool permissions.

Subagents handle delegated tasks in separate threads. Ideal for code review, debugging, security analysis, and other focused roles.

**Usage:** `/create-agent [name] [description]`

### `/create-command`
Create a new slash command for explicit user invocation.

Commands are manually triggered prompts for frequently-used workflows. Great for shortcuts, templates, and deliberate actions.

**Usage:** `/create-command [name] [purpose]`

### `/claude-hook`
Analyze your project and create hooks for automation.

Hooks trigger on events like file edits or tool usage. Useful for linting, formatting, type-checking, and security scanning.

**Usage:** `/claude-hook [hook-type] [matcher] [command]`

### `/create-plugin`
Convert a `.claude/` directory into a distributable plugin.

Package your customizations for sharing across projects or with your team.

**Usage:** `/create-plugin [project-path]`

### `/claude-md`
Generate CLAUDE.md files for project and key subdirectories.

Creates documentation that helps Claude understand your project structure and conventions.

**Usage:** `/claude-md [thoroughness: quick|medium|very-thorough]`

### `/claude-output-style`
Configure the user's Claude Code status line setting.

Customize how Claude presents information and responses to match your preferences.

**Usage:** `/claude-output-style`

## Installation

### Via Plugin Marketplace

```bash
# Add marketplace containing this plugin
/plugin marketplace add <marketplace-url>

# Install the plugin
/plugin install claude-code-toolkit@<marketplace-name>
```

### Local Development/Testing

This project includes a pre-configured development marketplace for testing:

```bash
# From the parent directory of skill-claude-plugin
cd ..
claude

# In Claude Code session:
/plugin marketplace add ./dev-marketplace
/plugin install claude-code-toolkit@dev-marketplace
```

The `dev-marketplace` is already set up with the correct structure pointing to the plugin source.

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd ~/your-plugins
git clone https://github.com/alexanderop/claude-code-create-toolkit.git

# Create a local marketplace
mkdir my-marketplace
mkdir my-marketplace/.claude-plugin

# Create marketplace manifest
cat > my-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "my-marketplace",
  "owner": {"name": "Your Name"},
  "plugins": [{
    "name": "claude-code-toolkit",
    "source": "./claude-code-toolkit",
    "description": "Create skills, subagents, hooks, commands, and plugins"
  }]
}
EOF

# Move plugin into marketplace
mv claude-code-toolkit my-marketplace/

# Add marketplace and install
/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace
/plugin install claude-code-toolkit@my-marketplace
```

## Usage

After installation, simply invoke any of the creation commands:

```bash
# Create a new skill
/claude-skill my-skill "Description of what the skill does"

# Create a new subagent
/create-agent reviewer "Code review specialist"

# Create a new command
/create-command my-command "Command purpose"

# Create a hook
/claude-hook edit "*.ts" "npm run type-check"

# Convert .claude directory to plugin
/create-plugin

# Generate CLAUDE.md documentation
/claude-md medium

# Configure output style
/claude-output-style
```

Each command will guide you through the creation process with questions about:
- Name and purpose
- Scope (project vs personal)
- Tool permissions
- Configuration options

All commands follow Claude Code best practices and include comprehensive testing instructions.

## Quick Decision Guide

**Not sure what to create?**

- **Skill**: Want Claude to automatically discover and use a capability based on context
- **Subagent**: Need a specialized AI agent for a focused role (code review, debugging, etc.)
- **Command**: Want a shortcut for a frequently-used prompt you explicitly invoke
- **Hook**: Want automation that triggers on events (file edits, tool usage, etc.)
- **Plugin**: Want to package and share your customizations
